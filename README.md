# Project Euler in Clojure

This is my repository for solving Project Euler problems, found at https://projecteuler.net

# WARNING!
## SPOILERS AHEAD.

I put a lot of time and energy into solving this problems, and you should too. Using someone elses's solution defeats the whole point of Project Euler, which is to improve your coding skills.  Therefore, if you happened to stumble across this in the search for a solution to a Project Euler process, I ask that you click Back on your browser now.  You'll thank me in the long run.

I've only made this repository public for the purposes of demonstrating experience in Clojure to prospective employers.
